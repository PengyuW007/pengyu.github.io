# Welcome to Pengyu Pages

My [personal resume page](https://pengyuw007.github.io/pengyu.github.io/).

I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/PengyuW007/pengyu.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview 
the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, 
from the content in these Markdown files.
For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

My Pages site use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme, which selected in [repository settings](https://github.com/PengyuW007/pengyu.github.io/settings/pages). 
The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
